                    For every US-based facility served by ICS, GTL, and Securus,
                    we aim to collect the following:
                    <div className="mt-2">
                      - The price of calls from a phone number that originates
                      <i> inside</i> of a facility's state for every
                      phone service (e.g. collect calling, prepaid calling, etc)
                      that a facility offers.
                    </div>
                    <div className="mt-2">
                      - The price of calls from a phone number that originates
                      <i> outside</i> of a facility's state for every
                      phone service that a facility offers.
                    </div>
                    <div className="mt-2">
                      For in-state calls, we use the governor's number as the
                      origin number, and for out-of-state calls, we use a
                      randomly selected governor's number from a different
                      state. We hold the randomly selected number constant over
                      time. For example, we will always use the Maryland
                      governor's number to check out-of-state rates in Alabama.

                  <div className="mt-2">
                    The first step in pulling rate data from telecom providers
                    is to run automated web scrapers against the publicly
                    available rate calculators provided by each of the telecom
                    companies we include in our data set

                    The raw scraped data that we save is full of incomplete
                    records. For example, we often encounter facilties that have
                    NULL rates reported. We discard these these rates at this
                    point.

                    In order to build a unified schema from disparate origin
                    sources, we need to transform the names of fields we
                    collect, and, in some cases, do some math to normalize
                    rates. In our database, a rate is calculated by adding the price of the first
                    minute, the price of an additional minute, and the price of any associated taxes.
                    You can find the full transformation logic{' '}

                    A core goal of PTDP is to make it possible for researchers
                    to contextualize the rates reported by telecom providers.
                    By, for example, providing the metadata about the population
                    of facilities paying a particular rate. The challenge here
                    is that the facility names reported by telecom providers may
                    vary in subtle and significant ways from the facility names
                    reported by external data providers (like the Department of
